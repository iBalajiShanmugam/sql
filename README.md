## Introduction to SQL for Data Analytics

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a powerful language used for querying and manipulating relational databases. In the context of data analytics, SQL plays a crucial role in extracting insights from data. This section provides an overview of SQL's applications in data analysis tasks, covering the basics of SQL syntax, common use cases, and the importance of SQL in data analytics.

## Big 6 Statements

The "Big 6" statements in SQL form the foundation for data retrieval, filtering, aggregation, and sorting. Understanding these statements is essential for effective data analysis. The Big 6 statements are:

- SELECT: Retrieves specific columns or expressions from one or more tables.
- FROM: Specifies the table or tables from which data is retrieved.
- WHERE: Filters data based on specified conditions.
- GROUP BY: Groups rows based on one or more columns for aggregate calculations.
- HAVING: Filters grouped data based on specified conditions.
- ORDER BY: Sorts the result set based on one or more columns.

## Operators in SQL

SQL provides various operators for performing operations on data. These operators allow you to manipulate, compare, and combine values in your queries. Some commonly used operators in SQL include:

- Arithmetic operators: +, -, *, /
- Comparison operators: =, <, >, <=, >=, <>
- Logical operators: AND, OR, NOT
- String operators: CONCAT, LIKE
- NULL-related operators: IS NULL, IS NOT NULL
- Set operators: UNION, INTERSECT, EXCEPT

## Order of Execution in SQL

When executing a SQL query, the order of execution follows a specific sequence. Understanding this order helps in designing and optimizing queries. The typical order of execution in SQL is as follows:

1. FROM: Specifies the tables involved in the query.
2. WHERE: Filters the rows based on specified conditions.
3. GROUP BY: Groups the rows according to the specified columns.
4. HAVING: Filters the grouped data based on specified conditions.
5. SELECT: Retrieves the specified columns or expressions.
6. ORDER BY: Sorts the result set based on specified columns.

Please note that this is a general sequence, and the database optimizer may optimize the execution order in some cases.
