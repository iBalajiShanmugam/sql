# PostgreSQL Data Query Language (DQL)

## 1. What is DQL?
DQL (Data Query Language) consists of commands used to retrieve data from a database. The primary DQL command is `SELECT`, which fetches records based on conditions and sorting rules.

## 2. Order of SQL Statements (Big Six Statements)
### **Order of Writing SQL Queries:**
1. `SELECT` - Specifies the columns to retrieve.
2. `FROM` - Specifies the table to query.
3. `WHERE` - Filters records.
4. `GROUP BY` - Groups records based on a column.
5. `HAVING` - Filters grouped records.
6. `ORDER BY` - Sorts the result set.

### **Order of Execution in SQL:**
1. `FROM` - Identifies the source table.
2. `WHERE` - Filters records.
3. `GROUP BY` - Groups records.
4. `HAVING` - Filters grouped records.
5. `SELECT` - Selects columns to display.
6. `ORDER BY` - Orders the result set.

Understanding this difference is key to writing efficient SQL queries.

## 3. SELECT Statement
The `SELECT` statement is used to retrieve data from a table.

### **Basic `SELECT` Statement:**
```sql
SELECT column_name FROM table_name;
```

### **Selecting All Columns (`*`):**
```sql
SELECT * FROM movies;
```

### **`SELECT` Without a Table:**
```sql
SELECT 1+1 AS result;
```
This returns `2` as `result`.

---

## 4. `WHERE` Clause
Filters records based on conditions.

```sql
SELECT * FROM movies WHERE genre = 'Action';
```

### **Types of Operators in `WHERE`:**
1. **Comparison Operators**: `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`
2. **Logical Operators**: `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`
3. **Range Operators**: `BETWEEN ... AND ...`
4. **Pattern Matching**: `LIKE`, `ILIKE`
5. **Null Checking**: `IS NULL`, `IS NOT NULL`

## 5. `GROUP BY` Clause
Groups rows with the same values.

```sql
SELECT genre, COUNT(*) FROM movies GROUP BY genre;
```

### **Rules for `GROUP BY`:**
- The selected columns must either be in `GROUP BY` or used in an aggregate function.

## 6. Aggregate Functions
Used with `GROUP BY` to perform calculations.

| Function   | Description                         |
|------------|------------------------------------|
| `COUNT()`  | Counts rows                      |
| `SUM()`    | Sums up values                   |
| `AVG()`    | Calculates average               |
| `MIN()`    | Finds the smallest value         |
| `MAX()`    | Finds the largest value          |

Example:
```sql
SELECT genre, AVG(rating) FROM movies GROUP BY genre;
```

---

## 7. `HAVING` Clause
Filters grouped records (unlike `WHERE`, which filters before grouping).

```sql
SELECT genre, COUNT(*) FROM movies GROUP BY genre HAVING COUNT(*) > 5;
```

---

## 8. `ORDER BY` Clause
Sorts query results.

```sql
SELECT title, rating FROM movies ORDER BY rating DESC;
```

### **Sorting by Column Index:**
```sql
SELECT title, rating FROM movies ORDER BY 2 DESC;
```
(Here, `2` refers to `rating`.)

---

## 9. `LIMIT` and `OFFSET`
Restricts and paginates results.

```sql
SELECT * FROM movies LIMIT 5;
```
Fetches the first 5 records.

```sql
SELECT * FROM movies LIMIT 5 OFFSET 10;
```
Skips the first 10 records and fetches the next 5.

---

## 10. `DISTINCT` Keyword
Removes duplicate values.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT genre FROM movies;
```

---

## 11. Aliases (`AS` Keyword)
Provides temporary names to columns or tables.

```sql
SELECT title AS movie_title FROM movies;
```

---

## 12. Best Practices
✅ Always use `LIMIT` for large datasets to improve performance.  
✅ Use `HAVING` only after `GROUP BY`.  
✅ Prefer indexed columns in `WHERE` for faster queries.  
✅ Avoid `SELECT *` in production queries.  
✅ Use meaningful column aliases for clarity.
