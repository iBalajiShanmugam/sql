# PostgreSQL Data Control Language (DCL)

## 1. What is DCL?
Data Control Language (DCL) in PostgreSQL is used to control access to database objects. It ensures that only authorized users can perform specific operations by granting or revoking permissions.

DCL consists of two main commands:
- `GRANT` â€“ Gives privileges to users or roles.
- `REVOKE` â€“ Removes privileges from users or roles.

## 2. Understanding Users and Roles
In PostgreSQL, **roles** are database entities that can own objects and have privileges. A role can be a user or a group.

### **Creating a Role (User)**
```sql
CREATE ROLE movie_admin WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'securepassword';
```
This creates a new role `movie_admin` with login capability.

### **Listing Roles**
```sql
\du
```
This command lists all roles and their privileges.

### **Creating a Role Without Login (Group Role)**
```sql
CREATE ROLE movie_viewers;
```
Roles without `LOGIN` act as group roles and cannot authenticate directly.

## 3. Granting Privileges
The `GRANT` statement allows a role to perform actions on database objects.

### **Granting Privileges on a Table**
```sql
GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON bms.movies TO movie_admin;
```
This allows `movie_admin` to select and insert data into the `movies` table.

### **Granting All Privileges on a Table**
```sql
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON bms.movies TO movie_admin;
```
Grants all available privileges.

### **Granting Privileges on a Database**
```sql
GRANT CONNECT, CREATE ON DATABASE bookmyshow TO movie_admin;
```
Allows `movie_admin` to connect to the database and create objects.

### **Granting Role Privileges to Another Role**
```sql
GRANT movie_admin TO movie_viewers;
```
This allows `movie_viewers` to inherit privileges from `movie_admin`.

---

## 4. Revoking Privileges
The `REVOKE` statement removes granted privileges.

### **Revoking Privileges on a Table**
```sql
REVOKE INSERT ON bms.movies FROM movie_admin;
```
This prevents `movie_admin` from inserting data into `movies`.

### **Revoking All Privileges on a Table**
```sql
REVOKE ALL PRIVILEGES ON bms.movies FROM movie_admin;
```
Removes all privileges granted to `movie_admin`.

### **Revoking Role Membership**
```sql
REVOKE movie_admin FROM movie_viewers;
```
This removes `movie_viewers` from inheriting privileges from `movie_admin`.

## 5. Best Practices
âœ… Use **least privilege** principlesâ€”grant only the necessary permissions.  
âœ… Use **group roles** to simplify privilege management.  
âœ… Regularly **audit user privileges** using `\du` and `pg_roles` views.  
âœ… **Revoke unnecessary privileges** when users no longer need access.  
âœ… **Use schemas** to group objects and manage access more effectively.
