# PostgreSQL Concepts

## 1. Data Definition Language (DDL)
DDL commands define the structure of a database, including creating, altering, and deleting objects like tables and indexes.

## 2. Data Manipulation Language (DML)
DML commands modify data within database tables, such as inserting, updating, and deleting records.

## 3. Data Query Language (DQL)
DQL commands retrieve data from the database, primarily using the `SELECT` statement.

## 4. Data Control Language (DCL)
DCL commands manage access control to the database, including `GRANT` and `REVOKE` permissions.

## 5. Transaction Control Language (TCL)
TCL commands handle transactions in a database, including `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`, and `SAVEPOINT`.

## 6. Indexes
Indexes enhance query performance by optimizing data retrieval.

## 7. Constraints
Constraints enforce rules on data, such as `PRIMARY KEY`, `FOREIGN KEY`, `UNIQUE`, `CHECK`, and `NOT NULL`.

## 8. Views
Views are virtual tables that present filtered or computed data from one or more tables.

## 9. Stored Procedures & Functions
Stored procedures and functions contain reusable SQL logic to enhance efficiency and security.

## 10. Triggers
Triggers automatically execute predefined actions in response to specific database events.

## 11. JSON & JSONB Data Types
PostgreSQL supports JSON and JSONB for storing and querying structured data.

## 12. Partitioning
Partitioning divides large tables into smaller, manageable segments for improved performance.

## 13. Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
CTEs simplify complex queries by allowing temporary result sets within a SQL statement.

## 14. Window Functions
Window functions perform calculations across a set of table rows related to the current row.

## 15. Full-Text Search
PostgreSQL provides built-in full-text search capabilities for searching large textual data efficiently.

## 16. Logical & Physical Replication
Replication ensures database high availability and disaster recovery using logical or physical methods.

## 17. Backup & Restore
PostgreSQL offers tools like `pg_dump` and `pg_restore` to back up and restore databases securely.

## 18. Performance Tuning
Performance tuning techniques include indexing, query optimization, and connection pooling.

## 19. Security & Authentication
Security features include role-based access control, SSL encryption, and authentication mechanisms.

## 20. Extensions
PostgreSQL supports extensions like PostGIS, pg_stat_statements, and more to enhance functionality.
