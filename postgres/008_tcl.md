# PostgreSQL Transaction Control Language (TCL)

## 1. What is TCL?
Transaction Control Language (TCL) in PostgreSQL is used to manage transactions within a database. It ensures data integrity and consistency by allowing users to commit, rollback, or save intermediate changes.

### **Why Use Transactions?**
- Ensures atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability (ACID properties).
- Helps recover from errors by rolling back to a safe state.
- Groups multiple SQL statements into a single unit of work.

## 2. TCL Commands
### **1. COMMIT**
Commits (saves) all changes made in the current transaction permanently to the database.

#### **Example:**
```sql
BEGIN;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 500 WHERE user_id = 1;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 500 WHERE user_id = 2;
COMMIT;
```
ðŸ”¹ Ensures that both updates are applied together.

---

### **2. ROLLBACK**
Undoes all changes made in the current transaction and returns the database to its previous state.

#### **Example:**
```sql
BEGIN;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 500 WHERE user_id = 1;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 500 WHERE user_id = 2;
ROLLBACK;
```
ðŸ”¹ No changes are saved if an error occurs.

---

### **3. SAVEPOINT**
Creates a savepoint within a transaction that allows partial rollbacks.

#### **Example:**
```sql
BEGIN;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 500 WHERE user_id = 1;
SAVEPOINT before_transfer;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 500 WHERE user_id = 2;
ROLLBACK TO before_transfer;
COMMIT;
```
ðŸ”¹ Reverts to `before_transfer` without affecting the first update.

---

### **4. RELEASE SAVEPOINT**
Deletes a previously created savepoint, preventing future rollbacks to that point.

#### **Example:**
```sql
BEGIN;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 500 WHERE user_id = 1;
SAVEPOINT before_transfer;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 500 WHERE user_id = 2;
RELEASE SAVEPOINT before_transfer;
COMMIT;
```
ðŸ”¹ Once released, you cannot roll back to `before_transfer`.

---

### **5. SET TRANSACTION**
Defines properties for the current transaction, like isolation levels.

#### **Example:**
```sql
BEGIN;
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 500 WHERE user_id = 1;
COMMIT;
```
ðŸ”¹ Ensures the highest level of transaction isolation.

## 3. Best Practices
âœ… Always use `BEGIN;` before making multiple changes.
âœ… Use `ROLLBACK` for error handling to prevent data corruption.
âœ… Use `SAVEPOINT` for complex transactions to allow partial rollbacks.
âœ… Choose the right isolation level using `SET TRANSACTION`.
