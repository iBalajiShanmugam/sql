## HAVING 

The HAVING clause is used to filter the groups created by the GROUP BY clause. It allows you to specify conditions that must be met by the groups in order for them to be included in the query results.

Here's the basic syntax of a query that uses the HAVING clause:

```
SELECT column1, column2, ..., aggregate_function(column)
FROM table_name
GROUP BY column1, column2, ...
HAVING condition;
```

The HAVING clause is placed after the GROUP BY clause and before the ORDER BY clause (if used). It specifies the conditions that the groups must meet in order to be included in the query results.

Here's an example query that uses the HAVING clause to find the total sales for each region, but only includes regions with total sales greater than $1,000,000:

```
SELECT region, SUM(sales)
FROM sales
GROUP BY region
HAVING SUM(sales) > 1000000;
```

In this example, the GROUP BY clause groups the rows in the "sales" table by the "region" column, and the HAVING clause filters the groups based on the condition that the total sales for each region must be greater than $1,000,000.

You can use comparison operators such as =, >, <, >=, <=, and <> in the HAVING clause to compare aggregate values. You can also use logical operators such as AND and OR to combine multiple conditions.

Here's an example query that uses the HAVING clause with multiple conditions:

```
SELECT region, year, SUM(sales)
FROM sales
GROUP BY region, year
HAVING SUM(sales) > 1000000 AND AVG(sales) > 5000;
```

In this example, the GROUP BY clause groups the rows in the "sales" table by the "region" and "year" columns, and the HAVING clause filters the groups based on the conditions that the total sales for each group must be greater than $1,000,000 and the average sales for each group must be greater than $5,000.

You can also use aggregate functions in the HAVING clause to perform calculations on the aggregate values. For example:

```
SELECT region, AVG(sales)
FROM sales
GROUP BY region
HAVING AVG(sales) > (SELECT AVG(sales) FROM sales);
```

In this example, the HAVING clause filters the groups based on the condition that the average sales for each group must be greater than the overall average sales for all groups.

Overall, the HAVING clause is a powerful tool in SQL that allows you to filter the groups created by the GROUP BY clause based on specific conditions.
