## FROM 

The FROM clause is used to specify the table or tables from which you want to retrieve data in a SQL query. Here's the basic syntax of a query that uses the FROM clause:

```
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name;
```

In this syntax, the FROM clause specifies the name of the table from which you want to retrieve data.

Here's an example query that uses the FROM clause to retrieve all columns from the employees table:

```
SELECT *
FROM employees;
```

In this example, the query retrieves all columns from the employees table.

You can also specify multiple tables in the FROM clause to join them together in the query. Here's an example query that uses the FROM clause to join the employees table with the departments table:

```
SELECT employees.name, departments.department_name
FROM employees
JOIN departments
ON employees.department_id = departments.id;
```

In this example, the query retrieves the name of each employee and their department name by joining the employees table with the departments table on the department_id and id columns, respectively.

You can also use aliases to give tables more meaningful or shorter names in your queries. Here's an example query that uses aliases in the FROM clause to join the employees table with the departments table:

```
SELECT e.name, d.department_name
FROM employees AS e
JOIN departments AS d
ON e.department_id = d.id;
```

In this example, the query uses the AS keyword to give the employees table the alias "e" and the departments table the alias "d", and then joins them together on the department_id and id columns.

You can also use subqueries in the FROM clause to retrieve data from a derived table. Here's an example query that uses a subquery in the FROM clause to retrieve the average salary for each department:

```
SELECT department, avg_salary
FROM (
    SELECT department, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
    FROM employees
    GROUP BY department
) AS department_salaries
ORDER BY avg_salary DESC;
```

In this example, the subquery in the FROM clause calculates the average salary for each department using the AVG function and the GROUP BY clause, and then the main query retrieves the department name and average salary from the derived table created by the subquery.

Overall, the FROM clause is a crucial component of SQL queries, as it specifies the table or tables from which you want to retrieve data and can also be used to join tables together or retrieve data from derived tables.
